Array init:
cppreference wants to initalize 
std::array<std::string,3> a = {"st","ia","np};
- Why not in course?
- Cppreference has #include <array>

PointerPointer:
- declaring a pointerpointer: 
    char **c_pointpoint{new char *{new char{'s'}}};
  Correct? can you do it like this?
- When couting both *c_pointpoint and **c_pointpoint gives
  correct result
