2. 
What is dependent name?
A dependent name is essentially a name that depends on a template paramter.

How is it related to the keyword typename?
it is related to the keyword typename in the way that we need to tell the compiler
if the Dependent name is a type. Consider the following:
    std::vector<int>::const_pointer * pt1;
    typename std::vector<int>::const_pointer * pt1;
The first line does not tell the compiler it is a type, therefore it will multiply lhs 
with the rhs. By adding the typename we tell the compiler that this is a type.

What ambiguity problems are related to dependent names?
